              'Can Kirby make an application accessible? The short answer is no. The accessibility of an application primarily depends on its markup, meaning it relies on how the components in Kirby are employed. ' +
              'Kirby components should allow developers to create accessible applications without hindering the process.\n' +
              'As a developer, you have the responsibility to ensure your application is accessible. While accessibility can be challenging, it is more manageable when considered from the beginning of the development process. ' +
              'Team Kirby believes that responsible frontend developers should prioritize and care about accessibility, viewing it as an opportunity to learn and improve products for all users.\n' +
              'To get started with accessibility, it\'s essential to understand that it is not merely a feature or an afterthought. Instead, accessibility is an integral aspect of any application that needs careful consideration and planning. ' +
              'By focusing on a different user experience (UX) for those with disabilities, you can improve your application\'s accessibility by understanding patterns, pain points, and usage methods specific to this audience.\n' +
              'Developing accessible applications requires addressing various disabilities, not just those affecting sight. ' +
              'Keeping this in mind, it\'s crucial to explore different topics related to web accessibility, such as evaluating accessibility, writing proper semantic markup, and using ARIA attributes correctly.'

              'Kirby also aims to be a knowledge source, highlighting do\'s, don\'ts, best practices, and anti-patterns as part of the component documentation.\n' +
